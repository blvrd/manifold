# Manifold

Manifold runs your stuff. It's directly inspired by , [Solo](https://github.com/aarondfrancis/solo), [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman?tab=readme-ov-file), and [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind).

## Installation

For now, find the latest binary in the releases section on Github. Put it on your `PATH` or stick it in one of your projects.

## Usage

Run `manifold` or `./manifold` if you it's in your project's folder. The program expects you to have a `Procfile.dev` file and will probably crash if you don't. If you do, you should see something like this:



I'd love some feedback! Does this work as a drop-in replacement for Overmind? Does it suck?
